# 🏡 Australian Housing Data Analysis Project

Welcome to the **Australian Housing Data Analysis Project** – an Excel-powered exploration into the dynamic world of property sales across Australia's suburbs. From suburb-level sales hotspots to the impact of bedrooms on pricing, this project unpacks real-world housing trends in an accessible and interactive format.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Real estate isn't just about properties – it's about stories. Each suburb, price tag, and agent tells a tale about how Australians buy and sell homes.

This project started with a simple question: _Where are homes being sold, and why there?_ What followed was a detailed breakdown of property types, suburb popularity, pricing clusters, and agency performance. Using Excel, we’ve crafted dashboards that reveal patterns hidden in plain sight – perfect for investors, buyers, and curious analysts alike.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

This analysis focuses on:

- Comparing the number of **houses vs. units sold**.
- Highlighting the **top 5 real estate agencies by suburb**.
- Visualizing **property sales over time** (seasonal trends).
- Categorizing homes by **price range** to reveal affordability trends.
- Exploring how **bedroom count affects pricing**.

---

## 🌐 Data Source

Data was web-scraped from the **CoreLogic** website and includes:

- Sale price
- Bedrooms, bathrooms, car spaces
- Property type (House/Unit)
- Sale date
- Suburb and city
- Real estate agency

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Processing

All cleaning and prep work was done in Excel:

- Removed duplicates and cleaned missing fields (e.g., “Sold by”).
- Standardized date formats.
- Removed outliers (e.g., $1 sale prices or invalid entries).
- Calculated statistical measures like **mean**, **median**, and **mode** to understand pricing distributions.

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights

### 🔹 Property Type Distribution
Buyers show a clear preference for **houses over units**, though unit sales remain significant in urban hubs.

### 🔹 Suburb Distribution: Spotlight on Auburn & Burwood

In **Auburn**, units dominated the sales, reflecting affordability and a younger demographic of first-home buyers. In contrast, **Burwood** leaned toward premium houses with higher bedroom counts, often selling well above the $1M mark. These trends suggest differing buyer personas: investors and new homeowners in Auburn, and established families in Burwood.

### 🔹 Top 5 Agencies by Suburb
Real estate agencies handling mid-to-high range properties (around $800K–$1M) showed the highest sales volume, especially in Burwood. Agencies in Auburn tended to specialize in unit sales and faster turnaround.

### 🔹 Properties Sold Over Time
December marked a clear **peak in sales**, likely due to end-of-year urgency. A dip followed in January before rising again in March, aligning with broader seasonal trends in the housing market.

### 🔹 Price Distribution
Most properties sold were in the **$1M+** range, confirming Australia’s competitive real estate pricing. However, **Auburn offered more options in the $600K–$800K range**, creating opportunities for entry-level buyers.

### 🔹 Bedrooms vs. Price
More bedrooms generally led to higher prices, but not always linearly. **Burwood’s** larger homes commanded premiums, while **Auburn**’s 2-3 bedroom units were more price-flexible, appealing to budget-conscious buyers.
